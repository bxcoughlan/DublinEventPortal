			<p>Stephens green serves us a treat over the 13/14/15th July with this ensemble of live music and open air events...

				<div id="toggleText1" style="display: none">
				<p>Stephens Green concert is proceeding just swimmingly this year, and, no that is not a pun
					on the poor weather conditions. Most of this years headliners have appeared and the
					feeling among festival-goers is they have not disappointed. Pulp will take to the
					stage later tonight, bringing the three-day festival to a close. Moths frontman Jack Colleran
					blissed out the crowd today despite the rain showers. This Club's brand of indie pop went
					down well with the crowds as did Oh Land's sparkling set.<br/><br/>
					There was a more laid-back vibe	over on the Main Stage with most onlookers choosing to laze
					on the grass and drink in the elegant sounds of Rachel and Becky Unthank and their fabulous band.
					Last night, one of Ireland's favourite bands, Arcade Fire took to the main stage hoping to relive
					their magical 2005 set at the same venue, a concert which effectively launched the act here. Lead singer
					Win Butler said "The first time we played Electric Picnic, it pretty much changed our lives.
					So we wanted to come back to say 'thank you'."They opened with Wake Up  and rolled through
					material from Neon Bible  and The Suburbs  before settling down to some stock hits from Funeral.<br/><br/>
					One of the biggest acts on Friday, Interpol, gave the crowd their usual drumskin-tight
					performance featuring modern indie classics Evil, C'mere and Obstacle 1. Seasoned festivalistas
					might, however, note that the departure of bassist Carlos Dengler has had a bigger impact
					on the band's stage presence than anticipated.</p>

				<div id="toggleText2" style="display: none">
				<p>The world's top touring band could have blasted off just on the fumes it emitted during
					a more than two-hour set in front of more than 60,000 rabid fans, many of whom waited a
					year to see the group after it canceled a June 2010 show at Qwest after Bono had injured his back<br/><br/>
					There were all kinds of space themes in the eye-popping show.
					First of all, the giant, four-legged structure that forms an enclosure
					for the stage was dubbed the Space Station by Bono (it's also known as The Claw)</p>

			<p>The Dubliners Suprise, a one-man show devised and performed by Declan Gorman...</p>
			<a id="displayText3" href="javascript:toggle3();">read more!!</a>
				<div id="toggleText3" style="display: none">
				<p>delivers well in the Mill Theatre, Dundrum on the 9th July in a one hundred seat theatre and would likely play to advantage in
					somewhat larger houses. It is Bachelors Walk Productions aim to take the show "worldwide",
					and to this effect they have devised "a unique crowd-funding initiative" of having patrons
					along the way sign an antique Signature Book dating from the period in which the work is set.
					It is hoped that donations from this source will fund their travels - an optimistic goal.
					This bit of codology should not detract from the genuine merit of the show.</p>
